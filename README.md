Welcome to my IoT Projects repository! This repository contains code and resources for various IoT projects that I've worked on. These projects explore different aspects of the Internet of Things, showcasing my experimentation and learning in this exciting field.

Projects Included
IOT Speedometer : This project integrates an Arduino-based speedometer that generates random speed values and a React Native mobile app built with Expo. The app reads these values and simulates a speedometer needle deviation accordingly.

Overview
IoT projects in this repository are centered around creating connections between physical devices and the digital world, utilizing sensors, microcontrollers, communication protocols, and cloud services.

Getting Started
Each project resides in its own directory within this repository. To explore a specific IoT project, navigate to its directory and follow the instructions in the project's README file, if available.

Prerequisites
Hardware:
  ESP8266 microcontroller (compatible with the sketch)
Software:
  Arduino IDE for uploading the speedometer sketch to the Arduino board
  Node.js and Expo CLI for running the React Native app

Running the Projects:

Clone this repository to your local machine.
Navigate to the React Native app directory.
Install dependencies by running:
  npm install
Start the Expo server:
  expo start

Use an Expo-compatible device/simulator to run the app.
Ensure the mobile app is connected to the same network as the Arduino board.

Contributing
Contributions to enhance the project, add features, or optimize code are welcome! Feel free to fork this repository, make changes, and submit a pull request.
